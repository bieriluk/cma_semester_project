## Abstract 

Computational Movement Analysis is a widely studied field that aims to analyse and validate trajectory data, to identify correlations, patterns and outliers in different forms of movement.

GPS data forms an elementary baseline for the analysis of movement patterns in various applications. This project focuses on Transport Mode Detection (TMD) using GPS tracking data from the POSMO app. This project implements algorithms in R for data processing, analysis and visualisation using publicly available context data such as public transport networks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-criteria analysis (MCA) for TMD even with limited optimisation of the underlying algorithms. Our project shows that an improvement of POSMOs TMD could be possible with our approach, needing an inclusion of other algorithms and data. The accuracy against ground truth, already showed a high comparability to POSMO, in bus detection the results were even better.

The project, while having some limitations in the implementation, presents ideas for further improvements in TMD from POSMO data, including the addition of height modelling, accelerometer data and supervised learning algorithms.
